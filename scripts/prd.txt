# Product Requirements Document: n8n Workflow Builder MCP Server

## 1. Executive Summary

The n8n Workflow Builder MCP Server is a specialized Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed to enable AI agents to create, modify, and manage n8n workflows programmatically. This solution bridges the gap between AI language models and n8n's powerful workflow automation capabilities, allowing AI agents to build complex workflows by understanding available nodes, creating workflow structures, and adding or replacing nodes as needed.

## 2. Project Overview

### 2.1 Problem Statement

Currently, building n8n workflows requires manual intervention through the UI or direct JSON manipulation. This process is time-consuming, requires technical knowledge, and cannot be easily automated by AI agents. As organizations increasingly rely on AI for automation, the inability of AI agents to directly create and modify n8n workflows represents a significant limitation.

### 2.2 Solution

Develop an MCP server that exposes a standardized interface for AI agents to interact with n8n workflow structures. The server will provide tools for exploring available nodes, creating new workflows, and modifying existing ones through a structured API that adheres to the Model Context Protocol standard.

### 2.3 Target Users

- AI agents (like Claude, ChatGPT, or other LLMs) that need to create or modify n8n workflows
- Developers building AI-powered automation solutions
- Organizations looking to streamline workflow creation through AI
- n8n administrators managing complex workflow ecosystems

## 4. User Experience

### 4.1 AI Agent Interaction Flow

1. **Discover Nodes**: AI agent uses search_nodes to understand available functionality
2. **Create Workflow**: AI agent initializes a workflow structure
3. **Add Nodes**: AI agent adds necessary nodes with appropriate parameters
4. **Connect Nodes**: AI agent establishes connections between nodes
5. **Test Workflow**: AI agent can trigger test executions or preview the workflow
6. **Iterate**: AI agent can modify, add, or replace nodes as needed

### 4.2 Example Interactions

#### Example 1: Creating a Simple Email Notification Workflow
```
AI: "I need to search for email-related nodes"
MCP Server: [Returns list with Gmail, SMTP, and other email nodes]
AI: "Create a new workflow called 'Email Notification'"
MCP Server: [Creates workflow.json with ID]
AI: "Add a trigger node at position (100, 100)"
MCP Server: [Adds node to workflow.json]
AI: "Add a Gmail node at position (300, 100)"
MCP Server: [Adds Gmail node to workflow.json]
```

#### Example 2: Modifying an Existing Workflow
```
AI: "I need to replace the HTTP Request node with a different node"
MCP Server: [Returns information about the node]
AI: "Search for nodes related to API requests"
MCP Server: [Returns list of API-related nodes]
AI: "Replace the HTTP Request node with the Stripe node"
MCP Server: [Updates workflow.json with the replacement]
```
